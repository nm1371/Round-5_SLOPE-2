# Round-5_SLOPE-2 code is associated to find  a feasible solution of the underdetermind linear system equations with bounded variables, that is,
argmin⁡  ∑ t_i       
s.t.    t_i≥0,                          i=1,…,n, 
        r_i≥0,                         i=1,…,d,
        || [V_(i,1),…,V_(i,d)]|┤|_2≤t_i, ,       i=1,…,n,
        ||[(SV)_(1,i),…,(SV)_(m,i)]|┤|_2≤r_i,         
Execution process: 'please copy the code in matlab.'
How to use:
Please set your file name, your sheet and your data range for matrix S on lines 7-9.
Please set  your data range for lower bound matrix L on the line 16.
Please set  your data range for lower bound matrix U on the line 23.
